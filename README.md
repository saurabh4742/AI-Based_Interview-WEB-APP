## ## Key Features ✨

* **👨‍💻 Dual-Tab Interface**: A seamless experience with separate, synchronized views for the **Interviewee** (chat interface) and **Interviewer** (dashboard).
* **📄 Smart Resume Parsing**: Candidates upload a PDF resume, and the application automatically extracts key information like name, email, and phone number.
* **🤖 Dynamic AI Question Generation**: No hard-coded questions. The Gemini API generates a unique set of 6 questions (2 Easy, 2 Medium, 2 Hard) in a single, efficient API call for each interview.
* **⏱️ Timed Interview Flow**: Each question is timed based on its difficulty (Easy: 20s, Medium: 60s, Hard: 120s), creating a realistic screening environment.
* **🧠 AI-Powered Scoring & Summarization**: Upon completion, the Gemini API analyzes the entire interview transcript to provide a final score and a concise summary of the candidate's performance.
* **📈 Multi-Candidate Dashboard**: The interviewer dashboard displays a persistent list of all candidates who have completed the interview, which can be sorted and searched.
* **💾 Local Data Persistence**: All interview progress and completed candidate data are saved to the browser's local storage, allowing users to refresh the page without losing their session.
* **👋 Session Restoration**: A "Welcome Back" modal greets users who have an interview in progress, allowing them to resume where they left off.
